This is the design that I preferred; I would rather use this application than the other two. The logic and idea behind it are far simpler
than those of the previouse two. Moreover, this application can be more efficient than the previous ones to keep track of the drugs present
in the pharamcy, as well as help patients/ customers search for the specific drugs (and dosage forms) that they need.
