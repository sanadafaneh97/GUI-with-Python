This is the first draft design. I designed a frame with buttons resembling the alphabets (A, B, C, ..., Z); whenever a user clicks a certain button corresponding to a certain alphabet, a new frame appears containing the drugs that start with that chosen letter. Note that if no such drugs exit starting with a certain first letter that its button was clicked, a frame containing the message "None found" will appear. Note that these frames contain a close button at the buttom to return back to the main frame.

If the button corresponding to a certain drug is pressed, another frame will appear containg information about that drug (name, aisle, side, coliumn, and row). Note that these frames contain a close button at the buttom to return back to the main frame.

After thinking about it, I realized that this design is missing other importan information about the drugs, like the diseases each drug treats, as well as the dosage forms of each drug. Moreover, the design itself is too confusing to assist the pharmacist in organizing their pharamacy, and might not be time efficient when a lot of clients/ patients are present in the pharmacy asking about the locations about their prescribed drugs. Therefore, I decided to discard this design.
